abstract = "Detecting anomalies is a problem that typically cannot be solved by traditional algorithms. In this talk, I will focus on three algorithms for detecting anomalies: Median Absolute Deviation, Local Outlier Factor, and Seasonal Hybrid Extreme Studentized Deviate. At the end of the talk, I will give advice on how to implement a real-world anomaly detection systems based on some of my experiences."
