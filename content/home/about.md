# Biography

I am the lead Data Scientist at STEALTHbits Technologies where I research and design anomaly detection algorithms for STEALTHbit's security software products. I am also pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Mining Massive Datasets from Stanford University.

Before that, I was a Data Scientist at Verizon Wireless where I developed customer segmentation models used by the Verizon's marketing teams.
