# Biography
I am a Senior Data Scientist at [J.P. Morgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) where I build internal data-intensive applications as part of the Global Technology and Infrastructure Applied AI team. In addition, I am a Data Science mentor for Thinkful's Flexible Data Science bootcamp.

I have previously worked at Rocketrip, Informed.co, STEALTHbits Technologies, and Verizon Wireless as a data scientist. I am interested in using my data science skills to solve problems with high societal impact. I am passionate about fairness and ethics in machine learning and educating others on these topics.
