# Biography
I am a Big Data Developer at AppEagle where I architected a data lake ecosystem for processing raw data streams in an efficient and easily accesible manner. In addition, I am a Data Science mentor for Thinkful's Flexible Data Science bootcamp.

Before that, I was the lead Data Scientist at STEALTHbits Technologies where I researched and designed anomaly detection algorithms for STEALTHbit's security software products.
