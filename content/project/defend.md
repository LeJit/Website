StealthDEFEND is an enterprise-scale security software for User and Entity Behavior Analytics to identify abnormal behavior indicative of compromised accounts or insider threat. As the Lead Data Scientist for STEALTHbits, I am responsible for the research and design of the machine learning algoirthms used to detect anomalous behavior. I work with development teams to integrate new algorithms into StealthDEFEND. I have given talks at [Data Engineering Conference]({{< ref "talk/dataengconf.md" >}}) and [PyGotham]({{< ref "talk/pygotham.md" >}}) about the algorithms and lessons I have learned while building the product.In addition, I collaborated with marketing teams to produce a series of blog posts on the company website about Local Outlier Factor, one of the algorithms implemented in DEFEND:
